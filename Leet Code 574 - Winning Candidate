Some of the compilers will not allow the above version So, applying the same logic in dfrnt way i.e wrting as cte.

  with cte as
  (select candidate_id
  FROM votes
  Group by candidate_id
  order by count(candidate_id) DESC
  Limit 1)

Select name 
From Candidate 
Where id in (select candidate id from cte);
